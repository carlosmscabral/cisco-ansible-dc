##  First, let's create VLANs 100-105 in the NX-OS devices.

  - name: Creating VLANs in NX-OS devices
    hosts: 
### there's no value to the key above!!! Ansible will complain
    nxos-switches
    gather_facts: no
    tasks:
      - nxos_vlan:
          vlan_range: "100-105"
          state: present
          admin_state: up


##  Now, let's add these VLANs (100-105) to a VLAN
## pool in the APIC

  - name: Adding VLANs to the APIC
    hosts: apics
    connection: local
    gather_facts: no
    tasks:
      - name: Creating a VLAN pool
        aci_vlan_pool:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "{{ apic_username }}"
          password: "{{ apic_password }}"
          pool: clive_rocks
          pool_allocation_mode: dynamic
          description: The coolest VLANs you will ever see.
          validate_certs: False

      - name: Adding VLANs to VLAN pool
        aci_vlan_pool_encap_block:
          host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
          username: "{{ apic_username }}"
          password: "{{ apic_password }}"
          pool: clive_rocks
          block_start: 100
          block_end: 105
          block_name: myBlock
          state: present
          pool_allocation_mode: dynamic
          validate_certs: False




##  Last, creating VLANs in UCS!

  - name: Creating VLANs in UCS
    hosts: ucs
    connection: local
    gather_facts: no
    tasks:
      - ucs_vlans:
          hostname: "{{ ucs_host }}"
          username: "{{ ucs_username }}"
          password: "{{ ucs_password }}"
          name: VLAN-{{ item }}
          id: "{{ item }}"
          state: present
        with_sequence: start=100 end=105
