##  First, let's check if we can connect to the NX-OS devices.
##  Here, we'll use a the nxos_facts module to populate a series
## of variables. We'll then use a second module, debug, to print
## one of these variables.

  - name: Checking connectivity to NX-OS devices
    hosts: nxos-switches
    gather_facts: no
    tasks:
      - nxos_facts:

      - debug: var=platform

##  Next, let's check connectivity to the APIC. We'll query 
## for all the existant tenants, save them on a variable all_tenants
## and then print it with the debug module.

  - name: Checking connectivity to the APIC
    hosts: apics
    connection: local
    tasks:
      - aci_tenant:
          host: "{{ apic_host }}"
          username: "{{ apic_username }}"
          password: "{{ apic_password }}"
          state: query
          validate_certs: False
        register: all_tenants

      - debug: var=all_tenants



###  For checking connectivity with UCS, we won't have right now 
### a 'facts' module. So, we'll use a trick! Let's delete a VLAN
### that we are sure does not exist!

  - name: Checking connectivity to UCS
    hosts: ucs
    connection: local
    tasks:
      - ucs_vlans:
          hostname: "{{ ucs_host }}"
          username: "{{ ucs_username }}"
          password: "{{ ucs_password }}"
          name: testVlan123456
          state: absent
